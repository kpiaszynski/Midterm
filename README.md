### Initializing (Windows)
To initialize, first create a virtual environment with:    
> **py -m venv venv**   
       
Next, activate the virtual environment with:      
> **.\venv\Scripts\activate**     
      
Finally, install the requirements for this project with:      
> **pip install -r requirements.txt**     
     
You now should have everything needed to create this web app.     
    
To access your watchlist, utilize uvicorn with:     
> **uvicorn main:app --port 8000 --reload**     
      
On app refresh any adjustments to the code will be implemented (assuming you saved it first!).    

### Back End
main.py, movie.py, and movie_routes.py contain all of the back end coding for this project. main.py initializes the fastapi app. movie.py initializes the classes/variables for the movie(s). This app takes a movie to have a unique ID, a mandatory title (outlined in the front end), a description of the genre, and an optional rating for once you have finished the movie with None being the base. movie_router.py initializes the routes for the front end to use. It also creates the storage list so the inputted movies will be saved.
          

### Front End
The front end is made up of a folder entitled "frontend." This folder contains index.html, main.js, style.css, and an icon of a movie camera (favicon.ico). The icon simply stays in the browser tab, representing the movie watchlist tab. index.html contains the code for setting up the Bootstrap buttons/modals for adding and editing movies, and links to the favicon icon, main.js, style.css, the Font Awesome star icon, and Bootstrap (the source for the modals). Also contained is a table for displaying the different movie categories, this gets filled by the JavaScript code. main.js is the JavaScript code for handling adding, updating, deleting, and handling the star rating system. I added plenty of notes within this file for ease of following along, as it is a long one. For related objects, I bordered the code with:       
> **//...Start**            
> **//...End**              

An IIFE (Immediately Invoked Function Expression) is used to display the stored movies instantly upon load.          
       
### Special Notes       
There are a few 'quality of life' additions. Firstly, you cannot enter a movie without a title. If the genre is unknown, you can easily find it with an online engine search, but if you do not know the title you may have a much harder time finding you movie just off of "Romance" or "Action." If attempted to enter a movie without a title, an alert will pop up reminding you of the forgotten title. The best quality of life addition are the stars that react to mouse events. Hovering over a star rating will turn the blank [white] star to yellow. Moving to the 5th star will incrementally light up the stars as they are passed over. Selecting a star will light it up, along with all previous stars. This is updated to the list as a value 1-5, and looks very pretty.      
The final mention is the .gitignore file. When using virtual environments it is important to protect your data from others. GitHub (optionally) generates a .gitignore file for whatever specified language you need when initializing a new repository. I used this for this project, but please note that many of the specified items in that file are not used in this project.
